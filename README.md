# Calculator 

This web application allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. 

**Link to project:** https://try-simple-calculator.netlify.app/ 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The application is crafted using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. Each button on the calculator is linked to a specific JavaScript function that updates the displayed result based on the user's interaction. The UI is intentionally simple and playful, reflecting the humorous approach of the application while maintaining usability.

The JavaScript logic handles arithmetic operations and updates the DOM to show results in real time. The design uses bold, clear text and distinctively colored buttons to provide an intuitive user experience, ensuring that even with its playful naming conventions, the functionality remains straightforward and effective.

## Optimizations

- UI Enhancement: Enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of the calculator with more sophisticated CSS styles and animations to make the buttons feel more dynamic when clicked.
- Functionality Expansion: Introduce the capability to handle more complex calculations, including multiplication and division, and possibly the inclusion of a history feature to track past calculations.


## Lessons Learned:

Implementing basic JavaScript events and operations reinforced foundational programming skills and DOM manipulation.
